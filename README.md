### About me 👾
New to the world of code, in the San Antonio program Codeup, I am fast-tracking my progress to jump into Data Science.
Can't wait to learn and share code with my fellow cohorts and future colleagues. 🖥

**Why I chose Data Science**
* I love detail-oriented work
* I wish to keep up and be part of the tech boom of our time
* I wish to use my tech skills to help startups and nonprofits in the future
* The versatility of working anywhere is a huge bonus
> The miracle is the more we share, the more we have. - Leonard Nimoy
